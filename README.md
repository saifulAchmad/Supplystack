## Methods
We began this project by collecting data on suppliers in Indonesia from various sources to gain a clear understanding of market needs and the potential for technological innovation. We identified that access to supplier information was limited, presenting a significant opportunity for technological enhancement. Our application addresses this by incorporating a chatbot that can search for and provide detailed information based on user requirements. We continuously evaluate the system to ensure its development aligns with identified user needs and market demands.

## Idea
Recognizing the need for easier and more detailed access to supplier information, we conceived the idea of developing an application that offers this convenience through a chatbot and customized search features. This product stands out in the market by offering access to information, primarily facilitated by the chatbot which provides specific and detailed data according to user requirements.

## Solution
The technologies used in this project include Azure Search, Azure Web, and Power BI. The application features a search function with filters based on region and a chatbot. These features assist users in efficiently finding the data they need by streamlining the search process and providing detailed information quickly.

## Problem-Solving Process
We identified significant challenges in locating data and the limitations of information available on the internet. To address these issues, we created synthetic data using ChatGPT tailored to meet the specific needs of our application.

## Target Users
Our primary target users are SMEs and the general public who need easy access to B2B services to suppliers. The application facilitates easy supplier searches with features such as name and location-based searches. Additionally, the chatbot feature allows users to input prompts and receive recommendations for suitable suppliers, ensuring they find the exact supplier that matches their requirements.
